# Matrix.cpp

A simple mathematical matrix class written in C++ to be reused for future 
assignments in my Computational Linear Algebra class. The Matrix class comes 
loaded with basic operations such as addition, multiplication, element access, 
input and output, identity matrix creation, and simple linear system solving 
methods.

## Disclaimer

I've uploaded this code primarily to demonstrate my approach to common 
problems involving matrices. The code almost definitely constains significant 
bugs and solves numerous problems in a naive, inefficient, and incomplete 
manner. Use at your own risk.
